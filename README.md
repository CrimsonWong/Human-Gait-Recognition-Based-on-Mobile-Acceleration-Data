# Human Gait Recognition Based on Mobile Acceleration Data

This is my project working with Jingbo Shi, Jinqi Liu, Jingyi Wang and Zheng Zhou. Our tutors are Liang Zhao and Shuai Jiao from Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

This project is an Android app, which aims to anticipate human body's movement. The process is to collect gravitational acceleration data from accelerometer in a cellphone, analyze data with Fast Fourier Transform and categorize different movements using machine learning.

Several knowledge points such as signal processing, feature extraction, classification and the activity recognition system are involved.
